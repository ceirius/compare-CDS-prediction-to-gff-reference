# compare-CDS-prediction-to-gff-reference
The following script reads both a GenBank (reference) annotation and predicted output, compares their predicted coordinates and populates these within an HTML5-compliant template. The output includes summary information at the top, such as: – Count of genes in the reference annotation – Count of predicted genes – Count of genes with exact matching coordinates between reference and prediction (5' and 3' agreement) – Count of genes with 5' agreement but 3' disagreement – Count of genes with 5' disagreement but 3' agreement – Count of genes predicted with no overlap to a reference gene It includes a table showing all gene coordinates of the reference annotation and, beside each, the corresponding (overlapping) predicted coordinates from the  tool.
